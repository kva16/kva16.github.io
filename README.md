I used ai just to help learn different formatting, understanding things, styling etc. in coding I was unfamiliar with. And then would play arounf with the things and figure most of it out on my own.

For example: 
    "How can I move this button around to wherever i'd like in CSS?"
    ChatGPT: 
    
    .movable-element {
    position: absolute;         /* Allows precise positioning */
    top: 50px;                 /* Change this value to move it vertically */
    left: 50px;                /* Change this value to move it horizontally */
}
 I did this as i was not sure how to move an elemtn around in CSS as I am quite new to it.

 Another example:
    "how would I implement a button into my html that would work with java?"
    chatGPT: 
    
    document.getElementById('backtoMain').addEventListener('click', function() {
  
    window.location.href = 'index.html';
  });
