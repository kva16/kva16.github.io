        My name is Kaleb Vinthers and I am a SIAT Major. My interests include playing soccer, golfing, design, anime, and going to the gym.
        I am currently attending Simon Fraser University in my 4th year. I previously went to Archbishop Carney for High School, where I took my first programming course.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical skills include knowledge of Python, Java, Processing, and now some HTML and CSS. I am also competent in programs such as Figma, Adobe programs, Rhino, and OnShape.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now, I have not done any technical work for a company but am looking forward to doing my first co-op soon and expanding my portfolio.
      </p>
